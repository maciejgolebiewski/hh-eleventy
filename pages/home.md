# Quit screwing around.

The DR50, 60, and 70+ backlinks we deliver put ear-to-ear grins on our clients

You’ve tried everything to get reporters and bloggers to do stories about you.

Press releases, emails, phone calls, notes tied to bricks thrown through newsroom windows, even HARO pitching—it’s all resulted in failure.

You got zero coverage and, consequently, zero backlinks.

But don't be so quick to give up on that last one—HARO pitching.

--

HARO pitching is actually very effective. The catch is you have to let HARO experts do the pitching for you.

If you had from the get-go called in a team of HARO professionals instead of attempting it on your own, you probably would have brought home a completely different result.

You probably would have been right now up to your amazed eyeballs in media coverage and backlinks.

And you would have likely avoided a ton of frustration and wasted time.

# HARO pitching can pay off big for your business.

In case you’ve never heard of HARO, it stands for Help a Reporter Out and it’s a tool news media people are heavily dependent on to connect with subject-matter experts they can interview and quote.

HARO is a platform businesspeople use to attract media coverage. Not just any media coverage, but coverage from major news outlets—the most coveted ones on the planet.

And with that coverage comes high-quality, to-die-for backlinks to your website. Do-follow backlinks, to be precise.
